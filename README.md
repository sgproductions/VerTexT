## Description
 
VerticalText. Read from top-to-bottom, right-to-left. English because we're still waiting for real support for languages that actually get written in this way.
Each line represents a digit, in HH:MM format.
Configurable! Please visit the config page initially to turn on/off some functions and pick your own design.

Note: Pebble Time Round compatible, but the design does not yield to the round display. It's up to you to decide if you like it or not.
